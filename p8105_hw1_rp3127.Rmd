## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Problem 1 basic information}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
head(penguins)
nrow(penguins)
ncol(penguins)
mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm,na.rm = TRUE)
table(penguins$species)
```



```{r Problem 2 plot, `echo = FALSE`}
ggplot(penguins,aes(bill_length_mm,flipper_length_mm,color = species))+ geom_point()+ labs(
x ='Bill Length(mm)',
y = 'Fipper Length(mm)',
title = 'Relation between bill length and fipper length for different penguins')
#Plot the graph of the bill length and fipper length and color in species.
ggsave('bill-fipper plot.png', path = 'C:/Users/A/Desktop/R')
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
